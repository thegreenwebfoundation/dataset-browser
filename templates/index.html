<h3>Green domains dataset</h3>

<p>Below is a browseable daily snapshot of all the green domains tracked in the Green Web Foundation database from the last twelve months, along with who they are hosted by, and when they were last updated.</p>

<p>This data is updated every night at around midnight, and the tables are sortable, and searchable. If you know SQL, can run queries agains the data in-browser, and download the data for further analysis or use as as JSON, or in CSV format.</p>

<h3>Real time cloud dataset</h3>

<p>Since 2023, The Green Web Foundation has been a member of the <a href="https://github.com/Green-Software-Foundation/real-time-cloud/">Green Software Foundation Real Time Cloud working group</a>, a project that has set out to define consistent, standard ways to report the carbon intensity of the computing hours sold by large cloud providers.</p>

<p>We have republished the key dataset created by the working group,
the <em>Real Time Cloud Metadata</em> dataset, here on this site, in a form where it can be easily queried, linked to, and downloaded.</p>

<p>See <a href="https://github.com/Green-Software-Foundation/real-time-cloud/blob/main/Cloud_Region_Metadata_specification.md">this link to documentation on the main project website</a> to understand what each column in the dataset means, and how it was created.</p>
